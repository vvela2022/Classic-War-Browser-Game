# Classic War Card Game

## Project Description
One player browser game variation of traditional war card game. 

For each hand, players will turn up cards at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to their deck. If the cards are the same rank, war is initiated and each player will place a card face down and another face up. The player with the higher rank will take all six cards. 
Play continues until there is one player with all 52 cards. The game ends when one player has won all 52 cards.

Note - this game version has two war scenarios built in.
